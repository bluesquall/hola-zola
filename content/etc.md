# Here is an example of how to add a custom section to the home page.

title = "/etc"
description = "other information"

draft = false
weight = 100

Here is a custom section for the homepage. You can put anything you want
here, just make sure to set the `weight` in the frontmatter appropriately
so that [`zola`] renders it in the order you intended.

<!---
As a reminder, you can use `HTML` comments in your markdown.
